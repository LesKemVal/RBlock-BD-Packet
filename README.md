# R. Block Nation – Funding Portal Partnership & Compliance Packet

This repository contains the official compliance and due diligence documentation for **R. Block Nation**, supporting both the **Regulation CF raise** and an **alternative/parallel Reg A+ raise** strategy.

## 🎯 Purpose

This resource is intended for internal review by:

- FINRA-registered funding portal partners
- Legal and compliance teams
- Potential escrow, tokenization, or backend providers

It provides structured access to:

- Issuer onboarding workflows
- Tokenized equity structure under Reg CF
- Form C (draft) and compliance documentation
- Revenue and valuation models
- Platform roadmap and tokenomics
- Alternative Reg A+ raise strategy (fallback or parallel path)
- Integration plans with Kore (free forever tier) and North Capital (escrow)

## 🔁 Dual Raise Strategy Overview

R. Block Nation is executing a **dual-raise model**:

- **Primary:** Reg CF raise hosted via a white-labeled funding portal embedded within our platform UI.
- **Parallel/Fallback:** Reg A+ raise running concurrently to ensure access to sufficient capital, even if Reg CF goals are not fully met.

Both campaigns will run until their respective legal expiration dates or funding thresholds are reached. Reg A+ revenue may be used to continue scaling even if the Reg CF raise remains incomplete.
