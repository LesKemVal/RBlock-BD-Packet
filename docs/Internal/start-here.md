# Dual Reg CF Raise Strategy Overview

This section outlines a capital formation strategy for R. Block Nation using **simultaneous Reg CF raises** to both (1) fund issuer campaigns and (2) fund the development and expansion of the platform itself.

This model preserves compliance under the JOBS Act while maximizing flexibility, community participation, and brand control ‚Äî all without requiring Reg A+ at the outset.

Unlike traditional startup capital raises, this model provides **proof-of-concept to investors**, who can directly engage with the product they‚Äôre investing in: a live, transparent, compliant investment platform designed for long-term JOBS Act alignment.
