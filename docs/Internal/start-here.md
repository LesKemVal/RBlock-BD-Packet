# Start Here – Overview for Funding Portal Partners

Welcome to **R. Block Nation’s Compliance & Partnership Packet**. This documentation hub supports both:

- 🟢 A **Regulation CF** raise (tokenized equity offering via a white-labeled portal)
- 🔵 An **alternative Reg A+ raise** (running in parallel as a fallback or co-strategy)

---

## 🔁 Dual Raise Model Summary

We are running **two legally distinct offerings**:

### 1. Reg CF (Primary)
- Hosted on a FINRA-regulated funding portal with custom UI integration
- 12-month lockup
- Max raise: $1.235M (target: $1M)
- Kore + North Capital integration (cap table + escrow)

### 2. Reg A+ (Parallel or Fallback)
- Runs simultaneously with Reg CF
- Allows us to generate platform revenue and investor engagement even if CF raise underperforms
- Funds from Reg A+ may support further development and compliance infrastructure
