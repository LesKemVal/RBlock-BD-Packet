# Offering Frameworks: Reg CF vs. Reg A+ vs. Reg D

This file explains how R. Block Nation plans to leverage three complementary JOBS Act-based frameworks: **Regulation CF**, **Regulation A+**, and **Regulation D**, each at different stages of the platformâ€™s lifecycle.

---

## ðŸš€ Phase 1: Regulation CF

Reg CF is the **initial launch vehicle** for platform validation and MVP buildout.

- Max raise: $5M
- Uses: Fund MVP development, legal/compliance stack, early marketing
- Submitted via: **Funding Portal** (no BD needed)
- Intermediary: FINRA-regulated funding portal
- Voting rights: None (non-governance equity token)
- Token: RBCB â€“ tokenized Class B units, 12-month lockup

This raise establishes product-market fit, traction, and compliance readiness.

## ðŸ“ˆ Phase 2: Regulation A+ (Only After CF Traction)

Only after meaningful CF traction will a Reg A+ filing be pursued.

- Max raise: $75M/year
- Uses: National expansion, onboarding 3rd-party issuers, platform scaling
- Submitted via: Funding Portal or Broker-Dealer
- Token: May offer optional voting rights
- Filing: Form 1-A, qualified by SEC
- Liquidity: Tradable immediately via ATS (once qualified)

Reg A+ is **contingent on CF success** and infrastructure readiness.

## ðŸ§© Optional Sidecar: Regulation D

Used for **private placements** to accredited investors, possibly alongside Reg CF or Reg A+ raises.

- No raise cap (Rule 506)
- No SEC qualification required
- Must file Form D
- No public solicitation unless using 506(c)
- Use case: Strategic partners, advanced investors, platform equity sales

This allows institutional or large checks while staying JOBS Act-compliant.
