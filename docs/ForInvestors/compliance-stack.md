## 🔁 Process Workflow

1. **Issuer Onboarding**
   - Documents collected via Kore
   - Compliance reviewed in partnership with funding portal

2. **Raise Setup**
   - Reg CF: Funding portal files Form C
   - Reg A+: Partner files Form 1-A (post legal review)
   - Portal embeds raise into R. Block Nation's domain

3. **Investor Flow**
   - Investor lands on issuer-branded page
   - KYC/AML handled by portal + Kore
   - Funds flow into North Capital escrow account

4. **Post-Investment**
   - Tokens issued via Settlemint
   - Investors receive access to dashboards via Kore
   - Revenue-sharing smart contracts activated

## ⚖️ Escrow Triggers

- Reg CF Escrow Trigger: ~$50K–$75K (soft launch)
