# Capital Stack Comparison: Reg CF vs. Reg A+

This table outlines the capital structure and operational use case differences between **consecutive or modular Reg CF raises** and a **potential Reg A+ rollout**, contingent on CF traction, platform readiness, and post-MVP progress.

## ğŸ’¼ Capital Stack Structure

| Category                  | Reg CF Raise                         | Reg A+ Raise (Future â€“ If Scaled)     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Max Raise Amount          | $5M (per 12-month period)            | Up to $75M annually                    |
| Investor Type             | Public / Retail                      | Public / Retail                        |

| Compliance Filing         | Form C                               | Form 1-A                               |
| Transfer Restriction      | 12 months (unless exempt)            | Freely tradable post-qualification    |
| Intermediary Requirement  | Yes â€“ via FINRA-regulated portal     | Yes â€“ via portal or broker-dealer     |
| Use of Funds              | MVP, legal stack, compliance ops     | Growth, acquisitions, scaling ops     |

## ğŸ§  Strategy Notes

- **Phase One:** Focus on CF-only raises to validate platform logic, investor demand, token structure, and compliance stack.
- **No Reg A+ raise will occur unless CF traction justifies scale.**
- **Platform-first funding**: The initial Reg CF raise will be equity-based and power the MVP, onboarding stack, and early issuer outreach.
- **Issuer-specific CF raises** (e.g., car wash, franchise) may use variations of the Reg CF contract with adjusted equity/rev-share logic.
- A Reg A+ raise may be introduced in the future only after CF raises demonstrate success, infrastructure is proven, and platform can sustain legal/BD burden.
