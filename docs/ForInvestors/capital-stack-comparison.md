## ðŸ§  Strategy Notes

- Reg CF is designed for fast onboarding and early adopters; it validates traction and token structure.
- Reg A+ allows scale, liquidity, and broader distribution with higher operational complexity.
- The dual-raise model allows the company to **hedge risk** by capturing capital through both channels while maintaining unified investor UX via white-labeled UI.
