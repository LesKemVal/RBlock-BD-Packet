# Issuer Onboarding Overview

This packet outlines the steps required for external issuers to list a compliant Reg CF, Reg D, or Reg A+ offering on the **R. Block Nation** platform.

Issuers will use this process to:

- Submit legal and financial disclosures
- Set up their Kore compliance account
- Establish escrow via North Capital
- Integrate with the platformâ€™s token lifecycle backend (Settlemint)

This onboarding process ensures each offering meets SEC requirements and aligns with the platformâ€™s long-term investor trust strategy.

## Phases

1. **Pre-Screening:** Internal review of issuer eligibility and offering type  
2. **Document Submission:** Required legal, financial, and business docs  
3. **Kore Compliance:** Cap table upload, KYC/AML review  
4. **Escrow Setup:** Escrow opened via North Capital or BD partner  
5. **Token Configuration:** If using smart contracts, Settlemint integration begins  
6. **Portal Listing:** Offering is published via embedded funding portal
