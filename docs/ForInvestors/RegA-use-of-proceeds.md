# Reg A+ ‚Äì Use of Proceeds

This document outlines the intended use of proceeds from the Regulation A+ raise conducted in parallel with the platform‚Äôs Regulation CF offering.

Both raises are launched simultaneously under the same white-labeled funding portal and operate on the issuer‚Äôs own platform UI and compliance stack.

---

## üéØ Dual Raise Context

- Reg A+ and Reg CF raises will run concurrently
- Proceeds from either raise may be used to fund platform development, operations, and compliance
- If Reg A+ completes first, it will serve as the fallback funding source to replace or supplement the original CF strategy

## üîÅ Strategic Reallocation Rules

- If Reg CF raise completes: Reg A+ funds will **extend** scope and support larger operations.
- If Reg A+ raise completes first: proceeds will be used to **replace or exceed** original CF goals.
- In both cases, the mission remains unchanged: build a **compliant, multi-issuer platform** under the JOBS Act, with in-house governance and BD capability.

---

## üß† Long-Term Goals Enabled by Reg A+

- Support for larger issuers and asset classes (real estate, royalties, franchises)
- Launch of dedicated in-house broker-dealer entity
- Expansion into Reg D syndication, SPVs, and qualified custodianship
- Onboarding of legal advisory board and investor compliance council

This use-of-proceeds plan ensures the platform can continue its core roadmap ‚Äî regardless of which capital raise completes first.
