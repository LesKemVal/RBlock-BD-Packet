# Simultaneous Reg CF Raise Strategy – Multi-Issuer Architecture

> 📢 **Disclaimer:** RBlock Holdings is a technology provider and is **not** a registered funding portal or broker-dealer. All securities offerings conducted under Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) are hosted on the platform of a **FINRA-registered intermediary**, with which the issuer maintains a direct relationship. RBlock provides tools, data infrastructure, and onboarding support — it does not execute securities transactions.

This timeline outlines a compliant, multi-issuer Reg CF strategy enabled by RBlock Holdings and executed in partnership with a regulated intermediary. Rather than launching a Reg A+ and CF offering in parallel, this approach uses **simultaneous Reg CF campaigns** — one for the core platform (RBlock Share Holdings, LLC), and others for affiliated issuers in vertical or franchise-style offerings.

The goal is to validate the system’s scalability while maintaining full compliance with SEC and FINRA rules.

## 📊 The Regulation Crowdfunding Journey with RBlock Holdings

The timeline is broken into three distinct phases:

---

### 🛠️ Part 1: Pre-Offering  
**(Powered by RBlock Holdings)**

Activities in this stage are supported by RBlock’s platform, but do not involve the sale or offering of securities.

- Initial planning and valuation strategy
- Business model development and due diligence
- Selecting a regulated intermediary (critical compliance step)
- Preparing Reg CF documentation (e.g., Form C content, use of proceeds, pitch materials)
- Community building, educational content, and audience prep
- Technical onboarding for integration with the intermediary

---

### 📢 Part 2: Active Offering  
**(Hosted by Regulated Intermediary)**

All securities-related activity occurs on the intermediary’s platform.

- Filing Form C through the FINRA-registered portal
- SEC review and portal compliance review
- Public launch of the offering page
- Investor traffic routed from RBlock-powered sites to the portal
- KYC, escrow, and payment handling managed by regulated parties
- Real-time campaign updates powered by backend integrations

📝 **Note:** No investment commitments are accepted through RBlock's domain. All investor actions occur via the intermediary’s compliant portal.

---

### 🔄 Part 3: Post-Offering  
**(Reporting & Long-Term Support)**

After the offering closes, RBlock continues to support the issuer through:

- Form C-AR and annual reporting reminders
- Post-raise community communications
- Dashboard tools for investor updates and onboarding future raises
- Preparing issuer materials for Reg A+ or Reg D follow-ons

---

## ⚙️ Strategic Advantages of the Multi-Issuer Model

- Reduces dependency on a single campaign or product
- Allows for parallel traction testing across verticals
- Encourages community growth across related offerings
- Validates replicability of platform-driven capital formation
- Accelerates product-market fit for both issuers and investors

---

## 🔍 Key Role Definitions

- **Issuer** – The company raising funds through a Reg CF offering
- **Regulated Intermediary** – A FINRA-registered funding portal or broker-dealer hosting the offering and facilitating compliance
- **RBlock Holdings (Service Provider)** – Provides onboarding, compliance tooling, and infrastructure — not a securities intermediary
- **Investor** – The end user committing funds through the intermediary platform

---

## ⚠️ Compliance Note

Each Reg CF raise is capped at 12 months. Escrow release, campaign length, and investor disclosures are governed by the intermediary’s platform. RBlock supports these campaigns through tools and integrations, but does not host or execute the offering itself.
