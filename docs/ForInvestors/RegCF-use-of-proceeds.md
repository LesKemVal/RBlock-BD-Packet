## üîê Compliance and Oversight

RBlock Holdings is a technology provider ‚Äî not a registered funding portal or broker-dealer. All investment transactions will be conducted through a **FINRA-registered intermediary**.

However, our platform is designed to:

- Produce **clean, structured data** that simplifies partner filings (e.g., Form C, audit trails)
- Automate **investor communications and transaction history** for post-raise reporting
- Maintain clear separation between **marketing, onboarding, and regulated activity**

We welcome direct collaboration with compliance teams to ensure all integrations and flows meet the intermediary‚Äôs standards.

## üîÑ Dynamic Deployment Strategy

If funding targets are exceeded, additional CF raises may be launched for:

- Investor dashboards, portfolio analytics, and messaging tools  
- Integration with secondary market systems (ATS platforms)  
- Reg A+ readiness: templates, disclosures, and audit layers  

We believe in **iterative, traction-driven scaling**, backed by ongoing community validation and legal oversight.
