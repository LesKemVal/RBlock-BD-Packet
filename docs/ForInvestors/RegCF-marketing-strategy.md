# Reg CF Marketing Strategy: A Partner-Centric Approach

At RBlock Holdings, we empower issuers with cutting-edge technology and data insights to develop compelling and **compliant marketing strategies** for Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) offerings. Our approach is built around collaboration with **registered Funding Portals and Broker-Dealers (FP/BDs)** — ensuring all promotional efforts align with SEC and FINRA rules.

This strategy reflects our **sweat equity commitment** to support issuers while **keeping our regulatory partners in the loop** at every stage.

> 📌 **Important Note:** RBlock Holdings is **not** a registered funding portal or broker-dealer. All investment transactions take place on the platforms of our regulated partners.

## 🎯 Strategic Goals

- Ensure all marketing stays within SEC/FINRA guardrails
- Build repeatable, transparent outreach systems for Reg CF, Reg D, and Reg A+

## 🛡️ Section 1: The Compliant Marketing Framework

We do **not** host securities offerings. Instead, we help issuers:

- **Structure narratives** and marketing disclosures in alignment with compliance expectations
- **Prepare materials** that direct investors to the regulated intermediary
- **Avoid unpermitted solicitation** by adhering to “testing the waters” and post-filing rules

### Key Components:

- **Pre-Campaign Compliance Review**  
  Issuers receive guidance on what they can say, when, and how — ensuring all materials are reviewed before public distribution.

- **Permissible Communications**  
  We help issuers craft compliant updates and promotions that drive interest without crossing legal boundaries. All calls-to-action lead to the FP/BD-hosted campaign.

- **Disclosure Management**  
  Issuers are supported in gathering and formatting all required information for the FP/BD to publish on their official offering page.

> ✅ We position RBlock as a **facilitator** — not a filter or gatekeeper — and **respect the compliance controls of our partners**.

## 🚀 Section 2: Driving Qualified Traffic to Our Partner’s Platform

RBlock’s content and outreach strategy is designed to **inform and attract** potential investors — then seamlessly **hand off** that engagement to your regulated platform.

### Tactics:

- **Digital Campaigns**  
  Targeted outreach via email, social media, and content marketing to generate investor awareness and education.

- **Landing Pages (Non-Transactional)**  
  Hosted on rblockholdings.com with clear guidance and redirect links to the regulated partner’s offering page.

- **Content Generation**  
  Compliant assets such as explainer videos, pitch decks, FAQs, and articles — co-developed with issuer teams.

- **Investor Analytics**  
  Our platform can surface engagement data (e.g., page views, link clicks, email signups) to help FP/BD partners understand lead quality and optimize conversion.

> 🧠 We **don’t just push traffic** — we prepare it. That’s our edge.

We’re committed to evolving with the market — and that means **partner-driven innovation**.

### Tactics for Discussion with FP/BDs:

- **Influencer Participation**  
  We’re open to exploring strategies involving key opinion leaders — provided all compensation, disclosures, and testimonials follow SEC and FINRA rules (e.g., Rule 206(4)-1).

- **Tombstone Advertising**  
  We’re prepared to co-design SEC-compliant "tombstone" ads (per Rule 134), focused on factual offering announcements with required disclaimers.

- **Additional Engagement Tools**  
  Whether it’s prequalified investor flows, dynamic educational content, or investor surveys — we’re ready to adapt to your compliance preferences.

## 🔄 Section 4: Seamless Integration with Regulated Platforms

We’ve designed our platform to **streamline the handoff** between issuer onboarding and the FP/BD’s hosted investment experience.

### Benefits to Our Partners:

- **Streamlined Issuer Onboarding**  
  Issuers arrive prepared — with narratives, documents, and structured data pre-reviewed and ready.

- **Enhanced Due Diligence Support**  
  FP/BDs gain access to issuer disclosures, valuation logic, and campaign context that simplify compliance checks.

- **Qualified Investor Pipeline**  
  We educate potential investors and direct them to your platform — giving you more engaged leads and stronger conversions.
