This document answers frequently asked questions about investing in **R. Block Share Holdings, LLC** through our **Regulation CF** equity offering and future platform roadmap.

---

## 💸 What am I investing in?

You are investing in **Class B non-voting equity** in R. Block Share Holdings, LLC via a token called **REGCFToken**. This represents a real ownership stake (equity) in the business, but without governance or voting rights.

---

## 🏛️ Is this investment SEC-regulated?

Yes. The offering is made under **Regulation CF**, a U.S. securities exemption regulated by the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)** and administered through a **FINRA-registered funding portal**. All KYC/AML checks are handled by **North Capital**.

---

## 🪙 What is the REGCFToken?

It’s an **ERC-20 token** representing your Class B equity. It cannot be transferred for 12 months due to SEC rules. Afterward, it may be tradable (subject to compliance).

---

## ⏳ How long is my investment locked?

Tokens are **non-transferable for 12 months** after issuance, as required by Reg CF. You will retain equity rights during this period, and may be eligible for future platform perks.

---

## ⚖️ What are the risks?

As with any early-stage investment, there is a **risk of total loss**. We are building a platform with real utility, but investors should only contribute what they can afford to lose.

---

## 📈 Will I earn dividends or profits?

This depends on the platform’s success. Class B equity holders may share in distributions **if declared**, but there is **no guaranteed income**. Our long-term strategy is to grow platform revenue and potentially issue revenue-sharing tokens (BFTKN) through a **future Reg A+ offering**.

---

## 🚀 What is the Reg A+ token (BFTKN)?

If this Reg CF raise succeeds and the platform gains traction, we may launch a **non-equity revenue-sharing token** called **BFTKN**. This would allow new participants to benefit from earnings **without diluting ownership**.

---

## 👥 Can I sell or transfer my token?

Not during the first 12 months. After that period, you **may be able to transfer** REGCFToken in compliance with securities laws. We are exploring future **ATS (Alternative Trading System)** compatibility.

---

## 🧠 Who manages the company?

R. Block Share Holdings, LLC is privately managed and led by its founder. Governance rights are retained at the managing member level to protect operational focus and mission integrity.

---

## 💰 What happens if the raise fails?

If the minimum funding goal is not reached, all funds are **returned to investors** and no tokens are issued. This is an **all-or-nothing** model, consistent with Reg CF rules.

---

## 🔒 How is my investment secured?

* Funds are held in **escrow** with **North Capital**.
* Tokens are only minted **after escrow clears**.
* Cap table, compliance, and transfers are managed via **KoreConX**.
