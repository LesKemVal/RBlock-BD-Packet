# Reg A+ Timeline – Dual Raise Strategy

This timeline outlines the parallel launch and progression of the Reg A+ raise alongside the Reg CF campaign. Both offerings are hosted through a FINRA-regulated, white-labeled funding portal and embedded into the platform UI.

The goal is to secure long-term capital while preserving early-stage traction and governance through Reg CF.

## 🗓️ High-Level Timeline

### ✅ Month 0 – Launch Phase (Simultaneous CF + A+)

- White-labeled portal goes live on issuer domain
- Reg CF and Reg A+ offerings both launched concurrently
- Marketing focuses on education, awareness, and compliance
- Initial goal: Secure traction via Reg CF while building investor scale via Reg A+

---

### 🔄 Month 1–3 – Early Traction and Validation

- Reg CF raise aims to meet escrow minimum
- Reg A+ accepts investments (longer tail, larger investor base)
- Community building + investor education via TikTok, email, events
- Budget is allocated dynamically depending on traction per raise

---

### 📈 Month 4–6 – Escalated Marketing & Onboarding

- Reg CF raise closes or scales past minimum
- Reg A+ raise continues, optionally expands into new states
- Legal and compliance resources scale based on available capital
- Issuer onboarding tools (Kore) and backend token stack fully deployed

---

### 🚀 Month 6+ – Post-Raise Execution & Growth

- Funds from either or both raises used to:
  - Hire dev/legal team
  - Complete cap table integration
  - Scale onboarding across new issuers
- Future offerings (Reg D or Reg A Tier 2) considered for platform expansion

---

## 🧩 Timeline Dependencies

- Reg CF raise may close earlier (12-month limit)
- Reg A+ may remain open up to 12 months or until fully subscribed
- Legal counsel will be secured once CF threshold is met **or** Reg A+ reaches a viable funding milestone

This concurrent strategy ensures R. Block Nation is not dependent on the success of a single offering to fund platform growth and compliance.
