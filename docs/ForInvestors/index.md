# Dual Reg CF Raise Strategy Overview

This section outlines a capital formation strategy for R. Block Nation using **simultaneous Reg CF raises** — one to support external issuers, and another to fund the buildout of the platform itself.

Unlike traditional startup capital raises, this model provides **proof-of-concept to investors**, who can directly engage with the product they’re investing in: a live, transparent, compliant investment platform designed for long-term JOBS Act alignment.

---

## 🧭 Overview

- **Structure:** Multiple Reg CF raises run concurrently via a white-labeled, FINRA-regulated funding portal
- **Use of Proceeds:**
  - Raise A: Capital campaigns for external issuers
  - Raise B: Platform development — compliance backend, smart contracts, onboarding stack, marketing
- **Platform:** Fully branded R. Block Nation UI, investor flows, and documentation site
- **Compliance Stack:** Kore (issuer onboarding), Settlemint (token backend), North Capital (escrow)
- **Ownership Model:** Investors receive Class B tokenized equity; subject to 12-month lockup under Reg CF

## 🎯 Objectives

- Raise from both traditional and underrepresented communities via accessible Reg CF offerings
- Provide investor transparency and platform engagement from day one
- Bootstrap the platform without requiring upfront Reg A+ registration
- Maintain full brand, UX, domain, and cap table control
- Build investor trust through a live proof-of-concept, not just pitch materials
