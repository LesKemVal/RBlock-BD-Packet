# üöÄ Raise Strategy Overview

This document outlines the phased capital raise structure for R. Block Nation using a dual-raise model: **Reg CF first**, followed by **Reg A+** only after early validation and traction. Reg D remains a possible sidecar route for accredited investors or strategic partners.

## üß© Phase 1: Reg CF Launch (MVP + Platform Validation)

- **Method**: Equity raise via Class B (non-voting) units
- **Vehicle**: REGCFToken (ERC20 token issued after escrow settlement)
- **Intermediary**: FINRA-registered **funding portal**, not a BD
- **Raise Goal**: Up to **$1.2M**
- **Investor Rights**: Equity stake, 12-month transfer lock

### Purpose:
- Fund MVP buildout and testing of tokenized raise stack
- Validate interest from retail investors and creators
- Test and optimize compliance infrastructure (KoreConX, North Capital, Settlemint)

## üß© Phase 2: Reg A+ Rollout (Only If CF Succeeds)

- **Method**: Non-dilutive token offering (revenue share)
- **Vehicle**: BusinessFranchiseToken (BFTKN)
- **Issuer**: R. Block Share Holdings, LLC
- **Intermediary**: Likely a BD-managed **funding portal**
- **Max Raise**: Up to **$75M annually**
- **Rights**: % platform-wide revenue (not equity)

### Purpose:
- Scale platform for multiple issuers and campaigns
- Offer liquidity, broader reach, and lower investor friction
- Diversify capital stack and preserve equity ownership

## üß© Optional: Reg D (Strategic Sidecar)

- **Target**: Accredited investors (VCs, partners, etc.)
- **Form**: Convertible note or capped token allocation
- **Use Case**: Strategic partners or larger backers during or after CF raise
