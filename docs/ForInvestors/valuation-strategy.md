## 🎯 Why a $100M Target?

A $100M valuation is a realistic benchmark for a tokenized capital platform that:

- Onboards 100+ issuers per year
- Automates compliance across Reg CF, A+, and D
- Integrates directly with investors via custom UI
- Offers digital securities lifecycle support via Kore + Settlemint
- Earns ongoing revenue via subscriptions, onboarding, and secondary trades

## 📊 Key Valuation Drivers

### 1. Platform Revenue

- **Issuer Fees:** Setup/onboarding fees for Reg CF and Reg A+ issuers
- **Subscription Revenue:** $40/year from early adopter investors (scalable to 10K+ users)
- **Smart Contract Minting Fees:** 1–2% of capital raised per deal
- **Transaction Fees:** 2.5% on peer-to-peer secondary trades via integrated ATS

### 2. Deal Volume

- **Goal:** 100+ offerings per year (post-scale)
- Average raise size: $500K–$2.5M
- Platform earns per-deal fees + recurring compliance/admin support

### 3. Ownership & Cap Table Efficiency

- Tokens offer revenue participation without equity dilution
- R. Block Share Holdings retains >51% governance control
- Early CF investors receive tokenized rev-share upside with clear utility

### 4. Strategic Partnerships

- FINRA-regulated portal + KoreConX + Settlemint = compliance moat
- Ability to syndicate deals across multiple portals + media platforms
- Potential acquisition target or BD-ready expansion by Year 2–3

## 🎁 Strategic Upside for Reg CF Investors

Early investors via the Reg CF raise benefit directly from:

- **Entry at Sub-$5M Valuation:** Locked-in token price reflects early platform risk.
- **Fixed Ownership Cap Table:** 23.08% allocation secures pro-rata upside.
- **Platform Revenue Participation:** Tokens may entitle holders to weekly revenue distributions.
- **Future Liquidity Options:** Anticipated listing on ATS partners (pending regulatory lockup period).
- **Early Conversion Rights (If Applicable):** In the event of restructuring, early investors may convert into equity or revenue share in future classes.

By investing at the earliest phase, Reg CF participants gain asymmetric upside if the platform approaches or exceeds the projected $100M valuation within 24–36 months.
