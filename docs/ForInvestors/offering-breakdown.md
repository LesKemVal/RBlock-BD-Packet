## üß† Strategy Summary

- Reg A+ = non-dilutive scale, treasury liquidity, mainstream investor access  
- Reg D = optional supplement for power investors, without affecting retail UX  

All offerings are modular and interoperable via KoreConX and Settlemint rails.  
Offerings may evolve by vote, performance, or market opportunity.
