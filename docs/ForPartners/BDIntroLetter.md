# Broker-Dealer / Funding Portal Intro Letter

📬 **This letter serves as an invitation to partner with R. Block Nation as a white-labeled Reg CF intermediary.**

## 🤝 Partnership Opportunities

In addition to acting as the intermediary for our Reg CF raise, we’re also open to:

- **Hosting third-party issuer deals** from your platform within our branded investor experience  
- **Offering commission-sharing** on hosted deals (terms negotiable)  
- **Remaining brand-forward**, with all raises conducted through your rails but displayed on our site  
  - Our **domain, UI, and investor onboarding** will be powered by [Kore](https://kore.inc) (white-label)

We believe this intermediary-only approach benefits both parties:  
You maintain regulatory control, and we maintain long-term investor relationships and UX continuity.
