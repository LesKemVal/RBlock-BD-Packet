## 🤝 Partnership Opportunities

In addition to acting as the intermediary for our Reg CF raise, we’re also open to:

- **Hosting third-party issuer deals** from your platform within our branded investor experience  
- **Offering commission-sharing** on hosted deals (terms negotiable)
- **Remaining brand-forward**, with all raises conducted through your rails but displayed on our site  
  - Our **domain, UI, and investor onboarding** will be powered by **KoreConX** (white-label)

We believe this intermediary-only approach benefits both parties: you maintain regulatory control, and we maintain long-term investor relationships and UX continuity.

We’d love to walk you through our cap table, platform logic, and partnership model.

Sincerely,  
**Lester Sawyer**  
Founder, R. Block Nation
