# Introduction – R. Block Share Holdings, LLC

Dear \[Broker-Dealer / KoreConX / Funding Portal Partner],

My name is **Mr. L. Sawyer**, and I’m the founder of **R. Block Share Holdings, LLC**, a Wyoming-registered entity building **R. Block Nation** — a platform designed to power tokenized capital formation under the JOBS Act.

This letter introduces our inaugural **Regulation CF raise**, hosted via a white-labeled stack that preserves platform brand, domain, and user experience. The raise is structured as a live investment opportunity **and** a proof-of-concept for supporting broader tokenization use cases.

## 🚧 What’s Been Built

* Formed a Wyoming LLC with full operating agreement and EIN
* Integrated **North Capital** (FINRA-regulated) for **escrow + KYC/AML**
* Established **KoreConX** account (Free Forever tier) for cap table + investor onboarding
* Deployed Kore-ready **ERC-20 smart contract** (RBCB token) via **Settlemint**
* Published structured compliance docs and public GitHub site (MkDocs-powered)
* Token includes built-in investor protections: 12-month lockup, pro-rata logic, mint control
* Created fully auditable offering packet with partner documentation + investor materials

---

## 🔍 Raise Details (Reg CF)

* **Offering Type**: Non-voting, tokenized Class B equity (RBCB token)
* **Raise Goal**: \$1.2M gross / \~\$1M net
* **Valuation Cap**: \~\$4.33M
* **Cap Table Allocation**: 23.08% to Reg CF investors
* **Revenue Model**: Subscriptions, minting fees, transaction % on platform
* **Exit Plan**: Expansion to Reg A+/D raises on same stack (multi-issuer roadmap)

> 📌 This raise is **ready to file**. Offering documents, Form C draft, cap table, and compliance logic are prepared and ready for submission.

## 🤝 What We’re Seeking

We are seeking a broker-dealer or funding portal willing to:

* File our Form C and oversee KYC/AML (North Capital can assist)
* Act as intermediary and escrow holder
* Allow us to **retain our own UI/UX, domain, and workflow** (private-label model preferred)
* **Defer upfront costs**, compensated via a **success fee (5–8%)**
* Optionally discuss revenue share or token participation in future offerings

---

## 🌱 Strategy for Scale

This initial Reg CF raise is the first live offering. The platform is being built to:

* Tokenize multiple offerings under Reg CF, Reg A+, and Reg D
* Support **retail and accredited** investors with robust onboarding tools
* Transition to full private-label KoreConX plan post-raise
* Establish BD and compliance partnerships that scale with the platform
* Onboard legal counsel and in-house dev team after capital raise

The Reg CF raise helps us validate this model with a real offering, while preparing the infrastructure for a **multi-offering investment platform** with revenue participation.
