# 📩 Broker-Dealer Intro Letter

Dear [Broker-Dealer Name],

I’m reaching out to explore a strategic collaboration between your FINRA-regulated entity and **R. Block Nation**, a tokenized investment platform designed for phased expansion across **Reg CF**, **Reg A+**, and **Reg D** offerings. Our initial raise leverages the **Reg CF** framework via a **registered funding portal** partner, with the intent to validate product-market fit, UI/UX workflows, investor interest, and core stack readiness.

Our tokenized equity product — backed by a compliant, white-labeled tech stack — will enable a range of deal types, including franchise, real estate, and IP-based opportunities. The goal is to build trust, deliver liquidity, and expand inclusive ownership.

## ✅ Why This Collaboration Matters

- **Reg CF Phase (Months 0–6)**: We are launching on a Reg CF portal and using this phase to prove traction. Funds raised will support MVP and compliance stack buildout.
- **Reg A+ Phase (Months 6–18)**: Upon traction and readiness, we plan to file Form 1-A to open access to larger capital flows via your BD relationship.
- **Reg D (Sidecar Optionality)**: High-net-worth and accredited investor tranches can be integrated concurrently with Reg CF or Reg A+, with your guidance.

## 🔍 What We Seek in a BD Partner

- Full-service BD operations for Reg A+ (filing, compliance, oversight)
- Compatibility with **North Capital** (escrow/KYC) or equivalent
- Collaboration during the CF → A+ transition to streamline issuer onboarding
- Success-fee-based model preferred
