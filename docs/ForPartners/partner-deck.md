## 🧭 Who We Are

**RBlock Holdings** is a technology and data infrastructure provider offering onboarding, education, cap table tools, and tokenized equity architecture — all designed to **support** and **enhance** regulated intermediaries, not replace them.

We are also a first-party issuer using our own platform as a **proof-of-concept**, with a live Reg CF raise conducted via a FINRA-registered portal.
