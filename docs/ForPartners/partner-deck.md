## 🧩 Platform Overview

Fully branded, white-label-ready investing platform designed to support issuer campaigns through a compliant interface.  
Built to integrate with FINRA-registered intermediaries (funding portals or broker-dealers) for Reg CF and Reg D/A+ offerings.

**Role of Platform vs. Regulated Intermediary:**  
While the platform (R. Block Holdings) provides user onboarding, content management, and investor education tools, **all investment transactions are executed through a regulated entity**. The platform UI does not host transaction functionality directly — it redirects to the intermediary for escrow, payment processing, and regulatory disclosures.

**Reg CF Compliant from Day One** (Reg A+ support in development)  
KYC, escrow, and smart contract infrastructure integrated via partners  
Community-driven campaigns with cap-table-integrated logic  
Clear separation between marketing, onboarding, and regulated transaction flow
