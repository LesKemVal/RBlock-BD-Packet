# Marketing & Outreach (POC)

This plan targets compliant investor acquisition and issuer education with emphasis on underserved communities, while keeping every touchpoint under BD supervision.

---

## Audience & Positioning
- **Reg CF (retail)**: first-time and non-traditional investors; community issuers.
- **Reg D (accredited)**: warm intros via partners and professional networks.
- **Reg A (later)**: broader public channels once approved; keeps the same supervision model.

---

## Community & Partnerships (primary channels)
- **Local partners**: Chambers, HBCUs/MSIs, small-biz groups, workforce & dev orgs.
- **Civic/faith venues**: churches, community centers, and landlord/merchant networks.
- **Influencers**: train on disclosures; pre-approved talking points; link **only** to BD-supervised offering pages.
- **Webinars (with on-platform Q&A)**: Q&A hosted on the platform to auto-archive.
- **In-person workshops**: education first; QR to offering page; no on-site transactions.

**Partner formats**
- Co-branded info sessions (agenda + risk legend).
- “How Reg CF works” clinics (issuer + investor tracks).
- Office hours with BD supervisor present or reviewing artifacts later.

---

## Conversion Flow (every path lands on supervised pages)
Outreach → Education content → **BD-supervised offering page** → KYC/AML & escrow → Confirmation → On-platform updates (archived).

---

## Compliance Guardrails (operate under BD WSPs)
- **Landing rule**: All ads, emails, posts, QR codes deep-link to the BD/portal offering page. No side signup forms for investments.
- **Reg CF “tombstone” ads only** (high-level facts + link). No promises, projections, or performance claims.
- **Legends everywhere**: Reg CF risk/illiquidity; “conducted through a FINRA/SEC-registered portal or BD”; no offer to sell outside the portal.
- **Archive everything**: ads, social, emails, webinar recordings, slides, FAQs, change logs.
- **Influencers**: written agreement, plain-English compensation disclosure (#ad), pre-approved scripts, link back to offering page only. No DMs giving advice.
- **Events**: sign-in (optional), distribute only BD-approved handouts; display legend; no taking checks/wires; route questions back to offering page Q&A.
- **Data**: use UTM links and analytics; avoid collecting PII outside the portal; exportable logs for BD records (17a-4).
- **Change control**: any copy/creative/template change requires BD pre-clear before use.

---

## Operating Playbook (POC)
- **Templates**: ad units, email copy, decks, event one-pagers (all versioned).
- **Approvals**: BD → stamps template version; we only publish approved hashes/filenames.
- **QA**: link-checks to supervised URLs; spot-check influencer posts.
- **Recons**: weekly outreach → traffic → portal metrics; exceptions reviewed with BD.

---

## KPIs (tracked weekly)
- Community events hosted, webinar registrants, Q&A threads created/answered
- CTR to offering pages, completion rate to KYC, escrow conversion rate
- Cost-per-approved investor; Cost-per-funded commitment
- Issuer applications started/completed (if applicable)
