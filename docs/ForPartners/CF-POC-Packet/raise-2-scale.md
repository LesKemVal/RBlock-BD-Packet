# Raise #2 — Scale (Reg CF)

**Goal:** expand platform capacity, issuer onboarding, and investor experience based on POC results; prepare path to FINRA registration for success-fee model.

## Offer Summary (draft)
- **Reg:** CF (through partnering BD)
- **Issuer:** R. Block Share Holdings, LLC (DBA: R. Block Nation)
- **Instrument:** ERC-20 equity (non-voting) continuing cap table mapping via Kore
- **Escrow:** North Capital (supervised by BD)
- **Smart contract:** New CF deployment (TBD) — separate address from Raise #1 for clear audit trail.

## Use of Proceeds (illustrative)
- **Scale infra:** multi-tenant issuer onboarding, queueing, monitoring/alerts
- **Compliance ops:** automated WSP evidence, exception workflows, 17a-4 archiving integrations
- **Issuer success:** templates, analytics, investor comms, reconciliation dashboards
- **Security:** pen test, threat modeling, incident runbooks

## Guardrails & Conflicts
- R. Block remains **non-BD** (no transaction-based comp) until future FINRA registration.
- BD pre-clears templates/UX, supervises comms, maintains books & records.
- Conflicts disclosed; independent principal reviews issuer materials.

## KPIs vs. POC
- Throughput (investors/day), onboarding lead time, exception resolution SLA
- Uptime/SLOs, error budgets, time-to-restore
- Data reconciliations across on-chain, escrow, and cap table

## Milestones
1. Close Raise #1 and publish POC report
2. Complete vendor due diligence updates (Kore, SettleMint, Escrow)
3. Ship issuer onboarding v2 and compliance dashboards
4. Prepare **FINRA registration plan** (see roadmap)
5. Launch Raise #2 with updated docs, risk disclosures, and audited flows
