# Marketing Strategy (JOBS Act–Compliant) — CF → A+ Ready

This plan shows how R. Block Nation (R. Block Share Holdings, LLC) will drive compliant investor and issuer acquisition—starting with **Reg CF** and maturing toward **Reg A+** and selective **Reg D**. It emphasizes outreach to underserved communities while keeping a level, compliant playing field for all participants.

---

## 1) Objectives
- **POC (Reg CF)**: Prove funnel + ops on a real raise; capture data for WSPs & due diligence.
- **Issuer Demand**: Attract small businesses/startups (including BIPOC-led) that fit CF; prepare pipelines for future A+/D.
- **Investor Growth**: Build a durable base of compliant retail investors (education-first), then scale through referrals/partners.
- **Compliance-by-Design**: All marketing pushes prospects to **on-platform** pages for disclosures, acknowledgments, archiving, and BD review.

---

## 2) Audiences & Journeys
- **Retail (Reg CF)**: Education → Eligibility → On-platform offering page → Acknowledgments → Subscription → Escrow.
- **Accredited / Sophisticated (Reg D/A+)**: Interest capture → Accreditation/qualification → Data room → Allocation.
- **Issuers (CF today, A+ ready)**: Simple pre-screen → Compliance readiness checklist → Onboarding via BD/Kore.

> All off-platform touchpoints link back to the **single source of truth**: the offering page (for BD pre-clear and archiving).

---

## 3) Channels (compliant guardrails)
- **On-platform content** (primary): FAQs, risk factors, use of proceeds, status updates.  
- **Email & Social** (traffic only): Teaser + **link back to the offering page** (no off-platform investment instructions).  
- **Community & Partnerships**: Chambers,, local dev orgs, small-biz groups; webinars with Q&A **hosted on-platform**.
- **Education Tracks**: “How Reg CF works,” “Risks & locks,” “What to expect post-close.”  
- **Language Access**: Bilingual summaries that redirect to the same on-platform disclosures.

**Controls:** BD pre-clears templates; maintain archive (17a-4), use link-backs, track change logs, and capture metrics for WSP evidence.

---

## 4) Equity & Access Focus (BIPOC communities)
We market broadly, with **extra outreach** to underserved and under-represented founders/investors:
- Partner with trusted community orgs; run **teach-ins** on Reg CF.
- Feature **transparent fees, risks, lockups**, and investor protections.
- Publish **cap-table and escrow state** updates on-platform (reconciled).

**Why this matters (evidence):**
- Since inception through **Dec 31, 2024**, **Reg CF has reported over \$1.3B raised** across thousands of offerings—demonstrating a growing retail path for small issuers.   
- The **racial wealth gap** remains large: in **2022**, median family net worth was about **\$285k (White)** vs **\$44.9k (Black)** and **\$61.6k (Hispanic)**—underscoring the need for equitable access and investor education. 

---

## 5) Messaging Pillars
- **Compliance first** (BD-supervised, archived, disclosures centralized).
- **Transparency** (fees, risks, lockups, timelines).
- **Ownership & outcomes** (what investors actually get; issuer milestones).
- **Community wealth building** (education + access; open to all eligible investors).

---

## 6) KPIs & Reporting
- Funnel: unique visits → KYC starts → completed subs → escrow receipts → allocations.
- Compliance: % pre-cleared creatives, on-platform link rate, archive coverage, exception queue SLA.
- Inclusion: partner events, geography & language reach; issuer diversity metrics (self-reported).
