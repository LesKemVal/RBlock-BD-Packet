# üìä Cap Table & Token Allocation Strategy

This cap table reflects our **phased dual-raise strategy**, beginning with Reg CF (Class B equity via REGCFToken) and expanding to Reg A+ (non-dilutive revenue-share via BFTKN) **only after traction is validated**. The structure prioritizes founder control, investor transparency, and regulatory compliance across both retail and accredited segments.
