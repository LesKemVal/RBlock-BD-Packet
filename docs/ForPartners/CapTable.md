# 📊 Cap Table Tools & Data Integration for FP/BD Partners

At RBlock Holdings, our cap table logic is designed to support our **Funding Portal and Broker-Dealer (FP/BD) partners** by enabling structured, transparent, and pre-reviewed equity data prior to onboarding issuers to your regulated platform.

We do **not offer cap table services directly to the public**. Instead, our tools are part of an integrated, partner-facing infrastructure aimed at simplifying **due diligence**, streamlining **issuer onboarding**, and enhancing the **investor experience** — all while respecting your compliance and supervisory framework.

## 🤝 Why Cap Table Transparency Matters to Our Partners

Our cap table tools help ensure that issuers arrive at your platform:

- ✅ With a **clear equity structure** already documented and tested
- ✅ With **tokenized equity classes** (when applicable) that follow regulatory requirements
- ✅ Ready to support **disclosures for Form C or Form 1-A** filings

By providing cap table snapshots, scenario modeling, and structured metadata, we aim to **reduce review friction** for your team and improve the quality of issuer submissions.

## 🧾 Cap Table Structure (Example Model)

| Class        | Description                          | Governance Rights | Notes                                      |

| **Class A**  | Founder/Common Units                 | Full Voting       | Retains core governance post-raise         |
| **Class B**  | Reg CF Equity Units (REGCFToken)     | Limited Voting    | Offered via regulated portal; 12-mo lockup |
| **Reserve**  | Partner, Treasury, Dev Incentives    | None              | Allocated post-raise as needed             |

> 📌 All final equity allocations are subject to SEC filings and review by the intermediary platform.

## 🔐 Supporting Reg A+ and Token-Based Structures

For dual-raise scenarios (e.g., Reg CF followed by Reg A+), our cap table tools can also model **non-dilutive, revenue-share instruments** such as:

- **ERC-20 tokens (BFTKN)** with bonding curve logic
- **Revenue-based distributions** via smart contract
- **Token-class visibility** for hybrid issuer capital models

> These are only enabled after SEC qualification and upon partner review. Tokens do **not** confer equity unless structured as such.

---

## 🛡️ Compliance Alignment

We work in direct coordination with our FP/BD partners to:

- Align all equity logic and investor documentation with **SEC/FINRA expectations**
- Provide **transaction-free UI/UX** for issuer onboarding and marketing
- Ensure all securities offerings occur **exclusively** on the regulated partner’s platform
