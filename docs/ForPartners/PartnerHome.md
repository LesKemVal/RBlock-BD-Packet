## 🧩 System Architecture
The platform integrates three functional layers:

1. **Frontend & Workflow Layer** — React + Tailwind investor/issuer UI  
2. **Smart-Contract Layer** — Verified Reg CF / Reg A+ contracts on Sepolia  
3. **Compliance Layer** — Integrated KYC / AML / Escrow / TA providers

## 🪜 Regulatory Plan
R. Block Nation will host compliant raises under BD supervision.  
- **Year 1:** Reg CF raises fund concurrent Reg A+ readiness and Jobs Act compliance.  
- **Year 2:** Tokenization monetization expands across issuers; explore FP registration if economically justified.  
- **Year 3:** Potential in-house FP/BD licensing or continuing under supervising BD.

All activity remains within the **regulatory scope of the JOBS Act**, **FINRA**, and **SEC Reg CF / A+ / D** frameworks.
