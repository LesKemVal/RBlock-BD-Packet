## 🔐 Token + Legal Logic

Cap table is synced and managed via **KoreConX**. All equity tokenization rules are enforced via smart contracts.

- `1 token = 1 Class B non-voting unit`
- Max supply = 23.08% of total units (can expand later under Reg A/D)
- **Transfer restrictions** (12-month lockup) enforced via contract logic

### 💡 Transfer Exemptions (Permitted Transfers):

- ✅ To the issuer (R. Block Share Holdings, LLC)
- ✅ To an **accredited investor**
- ✅ To a **trust** or **estate beneficiary**

### 🔁 Optional Buyback Logic:

Buybacks may be offered after lockup, based on future platform terms. Structured to protect investor rights and maintain fair market value.

## 📝 Additional Notes

- **Managerial Control**: Founder is the sole LLC Manager, retaining full control even with new equity issued.
- **Scaling Vision**: R. Block will eventually support multiple issuers; this cap table logic governs the **core founding entity**.
- **CF Round = Proof-of-Concept** for tokenized equity and compliance automation.
