# Bonding Curve Overview

The bonding curve is a token pricing mechanism that adjusts the value of each token based on total supply and demand. Itâ€™s used to manage price discovery, liquidity, and fair allocation during capital raises.

## ðŸ“Š Key Concepts

- **Curve Shape:** Convex â€” price increases as more tokens are purchased
- **Purpose:** Encourage early participation and long-term holding
- **Implementation:** Managed via smart contracts integrated with Settlemint

## ðŸ“Œ Why It Matters

- Simplifies investor experience with real-time pricing
- Supports pro-rata revenue distribution via Class B tokens
- Enables future transferability through registered ATS platforms (post-lockup)

> The bonding curve logic is designed to comply with U.S. securities laws and operates under Reg CF constraints.
