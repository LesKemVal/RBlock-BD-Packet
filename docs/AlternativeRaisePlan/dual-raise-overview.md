# Dual Raise Strategy Overview

This document outlines the structure, rationale, and operational flow for running a **dual raise**: a Regulation CF offering alongside a Regulation A+ offering.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Reduce funding risk** by running Reg A+ as a follow-on or parallel strategy
- **Increase capital ceiling** beyond the $5M Reg CF limit (up to $75M under Reg A+ Tier II)
- **Appeal to a wider investor base**, including both retail and accredited investors
- **Build platform credibility** with early regulatory compliance and scale

## ðŸ”§ Execution Model

1. **Reg CF goes live first** on your own UI via a white-labeled portal (e.g., North Capital)
2. CF raise builds proof-of-concept, user base, and initial liquidity
3. Simultaneously or shortly after, **prepare and file Form 1-A** for Reg A+
4. Use Reg A+ to expand reach, fund future issuers, or build platform treasury

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Strategic Value

- **Protects downside** â€” If Reg CF stalls, Reg A+ can provide backup capital
- **Enables marketing scale** â€” Reg A+ allows full general solicitation (paid ads, video, influencer marketing)
- **Attracts institutional or larger checks** â€” Many early investors prefer Reg A+ for clearer protections
