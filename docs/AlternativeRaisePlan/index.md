# Dual Raise Strategy Overview

This section outlines an alternative capital formation strategy for R. Block Nation using a **simultaneous Reg CF and Reg A+ launch**, both hosted through a single FINRA-regulated white-labeled funding portal. The goal is to ensure maximum flexibility, accelerate access to capital, and reduce single-raise dependency.

---

## 🧭 Overview

- **Structure:** Reg CF and Reg A+ raises launch together
- **Platform:** Embedded in issuer’s branded UI (via white-labeled portal)
- **Compliance Stack:** Kore (issuer onboarding), Settlemint (token backend), North Capital (escrow)
- **Ownership Model:** CF investors receive Class B tokenized equity; Reg A+ allows greater flexibility

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Raise capital from both retail and larger accredited/non-accredited investors
- De-risk operational runway by creating dual paths to funding
- Ensure platform buildout continues even if only one raise succeeds
- Use Reg A+ as fallback source for operations, marketing, and legal infrastructure
