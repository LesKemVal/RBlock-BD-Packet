## 🏛️ BD Review → RWA Tokenization Summary (2025-11-09)

R. Block Nation has completed all pre-live verification steps across its smart-contract, subgraph, compliance-API, and front-end layers.  
Both the **BD Readiness Checklist (2025-11-09)** and **Compliance-to-RWA Guarantee (2025-11-09)** confirm that the platform is **fully BD-ready** and structurally capable of supporting **real-world-asset (RWA) tokenization** immediately following broker-dealer certification.

This milestone establishes full continuity between the **SettleMint ATK** backend and the **Andes Capital BD oversight layer**, ensuring that North Capital escrow, Postgres + IPFS + Evervault storage, and the Flowbite-based investor dashboard function as a single, compliant issuance stack.
