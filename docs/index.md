# 👋 Welcome to R. Block Nation

**R. Block Nation** is a JOBS Act-compliant investment platform built for **retail-first capital formation**, launching with multiple Regulation CF offerings and expanding toward Reg A+ and Reg D raises.

We start by funding our own platform and franchise/startup projects using **tokenized Reg CF equity**, and plan to host multiple issuers with flexible terms. Tokens are issued using smart contracts (REGCFToken, BFTKN), and every offering integrates escrow, cap table, and investor onboarding via **North Capital** and **KoreConX**.

This site serves as our live documentation hub for investors, partners, and issuers.
