### 💡 Mission

R. Block Nation exists to open investment opportunities to those historically left out of private markets — including BIPOC investors and individuals from low-to-moderate income communities. 

We aim to break the mold of exclusionary accreditation rules by leveraging **Reg CF** to power ownership, participation, and growth. Our tokenized platform is built to democratize finance and offer **real stakes in real businesses**.
