> ⚖️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This platform reflects a proposed model for JOBS Act-compliant investing focused on expanding access to non-traditional communities. While the core mission — transparency, community ownership, and regulatory integrity — remains fixed, I am open to adapting aspects of the business model or tech stack to align with a regulated broker-dealer or funding portal relationship. My domain and investor UI are essential components of the brand experience, and I seek partnerships that allow for long-term valuation growth and operational integrity.
