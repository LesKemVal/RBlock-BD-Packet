# Introduction – R. Block Share Holdings, LLC

Dear [Broker-Dealer / KoreConX Partner],

My name is Mr. L. Sawyer, and I’m the founder of **R. Block Share Holdings, LLC**, a Wyoming-registered company developing **Our Block Nation** — a platform that enables startups and small businesses to raise capital via tokenized revenue shares, under Reg CF, Reg A+, and Reg D frameworks.

This letter introduces our current **Reg CF raise**, where we are offering a revenue-sharing token that entitles investors to a portion of the platform’s minting fees, subscriptions, and transaction revenue.

## What We’ve Done
- Incorporated as a Wyoming LLC
- Developed a Kore-compliant ERC-20 smart contract (see attached)
- Structured investor protections (bonding curve, pro-rata payouts, 12-month lockup)
- Integrated with Settlemint for smart contract management
- Fully prepared offering documents, Git repo, and raise materials
- Set up auto-revenue distribution to token holders weekly via smart contract

## Raise Overview
- **Goal**: $530,000 under Reg CF
- **Instrument**: Revenue-share token (no equity/governance)
- **Minimum Investment**: TBD (likely $100–$250)
- **Use of Funds**: Platform dev, BD onboarding, Kore fees, legal, investor tools
- **Revenue Streams**: Minting fees, subscriptions, 2.5% transaction fees
- **Exit Plan**: Platform expansion to Reg A+ / D issuers with ATS integration

## Ask
We are seeking a broker-dealer to:
- File Form C and manage KYC/AML
- Hold investor funds in escrow
- Assist with compliance monitoring

We prefer to work with a partner willing to **defer upfront payment** and instead earn a **success fee (e.g. 5–8%)**. We are also open to discussing **revenue share incentives or token-based participation** in future offerings.

All key documentation is prepared and available upon request.

Looking forward to discussing next steps.

Sincerely,  
Mr. L. Sawyer
