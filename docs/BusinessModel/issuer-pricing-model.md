# Issuer Pricing Model

The pricing model for issuers reflects our commitment to affordability, transparency, and platform alignment with long-term issuer success.

### Core Principles:
- âœ… No upfront fee for Reg CF issuers launching via our platform.
- ðŸ’¸ A **% success fee** will be collected only if the campaign is successful.
- ðŸŽ¯ Additional features like token analytics, treasury management, and subscription dashboards are available via tiered pricing.
- ðŸ“ˆ Platform participation via treasury allocations ensures aligned incentives with issuer success.

### Optional Upgrades (Post-Raise):
- Analytics Dashboard Access (investor activity, liquidity)
- Early Access to Secondary Listings
- Token Vesting/Cliff Customizations
- Franchisor Integration (for franchise offerings)
- Real-World Asset Tokenization Support (debt, rev-share, royalties)

> Our long-term strategy includes offering a white-label entity-management system for issuers scaling into multiple locations or franchises.
