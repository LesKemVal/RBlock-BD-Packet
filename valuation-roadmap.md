# R. Block Nation | Valuation Roadmap

## üéØ Minimum Valuation Goal: $100M+

## üí° Valuation Growth Drivers

1. **Tokenized Asset Acquisition**
   - Founder-led acquisitions of startups, franchises, or creator IP
   - Tokens issued directly by platform (RBCB, rev-share, or debt)
   - Founder retains Class A governance and management rights
   - Investors receive Class B (non-voting) or rev-share tokens

2. **Recurring Platform Revenue**
   - Subscription tier: $40/year per investor
     - Early deal access
     - Analytics + alerts
     - Secondary watchlists (future)
   - White-label onboarding UI for issuers
   - Token lifecycle fees (redemptions, listings, KYC/AML updates)

3. **Capital Formation Engine**
   - Reg CF raises for early-stage issuers
   - Reg A+ and Reg D expansion post-BD acquisition
   - Multi-token support (equity, rev-share, real estate, debt)

4. **Future Lending Integration**
   - Once **franchise theory is proven**, investors will gain access to financing tools
   - Allows investors to buy 80‚Äì100% of tokenized franchise positions
   - Converts passive investments into active business ownership
   - Drives demand, token velocity, and real-world integration

## üìà Treasury Allocation (Ethical, Sustainable)

For each tokenized offering hosted by the platform, R. Block Nation may retain a **small treasury allocation** of non-governance tokens (rev-share, debt, or equity tokens where appropriate).

- This will **never disadvantage investors**
- Transparent, capped, and disclosed in each offering
- Builds a platform balance sheet over time
- Boosts valuation for future institutional and M&A partners
