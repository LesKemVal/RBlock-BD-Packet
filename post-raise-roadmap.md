# R. Block Nation | Post-Raise Execution Roadmap

## 🧭 Overview

This roadmap outlines the 30/60/90-day execution plan following the close of the Reg CF raise. It reflects the founder's dual role as both platform operator and first issuer, and the platform’s acquisition-based strategy to scale revenue and valuation. 

Each milestone supports the long-term goal of building a vertically integrated, tokenized investment platform with in-house Broker-Dealer capabilities.
