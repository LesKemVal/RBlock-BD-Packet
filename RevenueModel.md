# Our Block Nation – Revenue Model

## Objective
Estimate how many issuers and transactions are required to reach $1M/month in gross platform revenue.

---

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Minting Fees  
Charged when issuers launch tokens (e.g. 3% of capital raised)

- Avg raise per issuer: $250,000  
- Platform cut (minting fee): 3% = $7,500/issuer  

### 2. Subscription Fees  
Charged to issuers for using the platform

- Monthly subscription: $299/issuer  

### 3. Transaction Fees  
Collected from secondary trades (2.5%)

- Monthly trade volume estimate: Varies by adoption  
- Platform cut: 2.5% of all transactions

## Sample Model: Revenue to Reach $1M/Month

| Metric | Estimate | Monthly Revenue |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Active Issuers | 200 | 200 × $299 = $59,800 |
| New Issuers (mint fees) | 100 | 100 × $7,500 = $750,000 |
| Secondary Trade Volume | $7M | 2.5% × $7M = $175,000 |
| **Total Est. Revenue** | — | **$984,800/month** |

---

## Breakeven Scenario (Example)

| Category | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| Platform Ops | $35,000 |
| Compliance & Kore Fees | $25,000 |
| Marketing & Growth | $40,000 |
| Legal & Admin | $15,000 |
| **Total Expenses** | — | **$115,000/month** |

---

## Notes

- Goal: Reach $1M/month with 100 new issuers/month and 200 active  
- Trade volume is key to sustaining high monthly revenue  
- Subscription base provides recurring stability  
- Model will improve as more data comes in from actual use
