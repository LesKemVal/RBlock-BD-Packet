## 🧩 Platform Flexibility for Other Issuers

While this cap table reflects the founder’s structure, **R. Block Nation is designed to support a wide variety of issuer types**, including:

- Voting or non-voting equity offerings  
- Revenue-share token models (creator economy, startups, services)  
- Tokenized debt or real estate assets  
- Reg CF, Reg A+, or Reg D campaigns

Each issuer defines its own equity/token terms. The platform facilitates compliant onboarding, cap table tracking, and investor communications — but does **not enforce a uniform capital structure**.

---

## 🔐 Founder Control Logic

- The **Class A stake remains untouched** during the Reg CF raise  
- Class B (non-voting) tokens are issued to investors  
- Founder retains full **governance control and management authority**  
- Long-term growth is driven by **acquisition and tokenization of revenue-producing assets** under R. Block Nation
