## 🔐 Founder Control Logic

- The **Class A stake remains untouched** during the Reg CF raise
- Class B (non-voting) units are issued as **equity tokens (RBCB)** on-chain
- Founder retains **full governance rights** and majority control through Class A

---

## 🔄 Future Considerations

- **Class C** shares may be introduced for:
  - Broker-dealer equity partners
  - Strategic alliances
  - Future convertible offerings (Reg A+, Reg D)

- Cap table updates will be tokenized and managed via Kore + blockchain contracts
